      magic: "Built a self-updating Product Knowledge vault in Obsidian. Claude tags and organizes everything: meeting notes, reports, OKR updates. Now when I need a user story, it already knows our platform quirks and that weird legacy API we pretend doesn't exist.",
      metric: "Context setup time reduced by 95%. Turns out my brain has limited RAM for cross-team dependencies.",

      magic: "Mapped out which repos handle which product flows, then trained myself to ask Copilot the right questions. Now I can verify tracking events, check form validations, understand API responses. Basically speak dev without actually learning to code.",

                The results? My dev team calls me unblocker and thinks I have supernatural memory powers. Stakeholders wonder how I get data so fast, and I somehow reduced context setup time by 95%. Want to know my secret?
